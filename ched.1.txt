CHED(1)
=======


NAME
----
ched - cached command run


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ched* [*-t* 'TIMEOUT'] 'command'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*ched* is a cached command runner.  At the first time running a command, (ca)*ched*
stores its output in a cache.  At subsequent calls to the command with *ched*, up
to a certain time threshold, the output of cache is used.

This is a prototype version.

Caution should be noted when using this to run commands with side effects.


OPTIONS
-------
*-h*, *--help*::
	Shows help

*-v*, *--version*::
	Shows version

*-t*, *--timeout*='SECONDS'::
	Holds cache until 'SECONDS' seconds.  Default is 10 seconds.

*-i*, *--ignore-working-dir*::
	Ignore working dir when chaching.  This can be used with commands that have
	the same output when executed on different working directories.

*-e*, *--cache-stderr*::
	Activates stderr caching.  (not implemented)

*--dont-cache-on-error*::
	Don't cache on error.  (not implemented)

EXAMPLES
--------
*ched ls*

Does a cached list of a directory.

*ched -t 60 links -dump example.com/friends_list*

Does a cached access of a url with a cache timeout of 60 seconds.

*ched hg status*

Does a mercurial status command on some directory.  This might be useful when
implementing scripts for bash smart completion. On Mercurial version 2.7, it is
enough to change two lines in the completion file
(``/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/hg'').  Please note that is enough to
create another with the modified contents and source it.  The two lines are
shown below:

    ...
    -    HGPLAIN=1 "$hg" "$@" 2>/dev/null
    +    HGPLAIN=1 "/path/to/ched" "$hg" "$@" 2>/dev/null
    ...

    ...
    -    local files="$(_hg_cmd status -n$1 "glob:$cur**")"
    +    local files="$(_hg_cmd status -n$1 "glob:**" | grep "^$cur")"
    ...

If you want to run a cached shell command or a shell function, be sure to
export in the case of the function and to prepend the command with ``sh -c'':

	helloworld() {
		echo "hello world $1"
	}
	export -f helloworld
	ched sh -c "helloworld yourname"

Originally it was thought to have the option *--shell-exec* to activate that,
since it can be easily done as shown above, this idea was dropped.


FILES
-----

The cache for each command is stored under md5 named files under ``$HOME/.cache/ched''.
