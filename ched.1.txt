CHED(1)
=======


NAME
----
ched - cached command run


SYNOPSIS
--------
*ched* 'command'


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*ched* is a cached command runner.  At the first time running a command, (ca)*ched*
stores its output in a cache.  At subsequent calls to the command with *ched*, up
to a certain time threshold, the output of cache is used.

This is a prototype version.

Caution should be noted when using this to run commands with side effects.


OPTIONS
-------
*-h*, *--help*::
	Shows help (not implemented)

*-v*, *--version*::
	Shows version (not implemented)

*-t*, *--timeout*='SECONDS'::
	Holds cache until 'SECONDS' seconds.  Default is 5 seconds.

*-e*, *--cache-stderr*::
	Activates stderr caching.  (not implemented)

*--dont-cache-on-error*::
	Don't cache on error.  (not implemented)

*--ignore-working-dir*::
	Ignore working dir when chaching.  This should be used with commands that
	do not have a different output when executed on different working
	directories.

*-s*, *--shell-exec*::
	For default, ched executes commands directly.  Use this option to execute
	commands with ``sh -c''.  This is useful when running bash functions for
	example.

*-x*, *--exec*::
	Executes a command directly without using ``sh -c''.  Reverts the effect of
	'-s' option.  This is the default.


EXAMPLES
--------
*ched ls*

Does a cached list of a directory.

*ched links -dump example.com/friends_list*

Does a cached access of a url.

*ched hg status*

Does a mercurial status command on some directory.  This might be useful when
implementing scripts for bash smart completion. On Mercurial version 2.7, it is
enough to change two lines in the completion file
(``/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/hg'').  Please note that is enough to
create another with the modified contents and source it.  The two lines are
shown below:

    ...
    -    HGPLAIN=1 "$hg" "$@" 2>/dev/null
    +    HGPLAIN=1 "/path/to/ched" "$hg" "$@" 2>/dev/null
    ...

    ...
    -    local files="$(_hg_cmd status -n$1 "glob:$cur**")"
    +    local files="$(_hg_cmd status -n$1 "glob:**" | grep "^$cur")"
    ...
