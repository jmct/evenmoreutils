SGETOPT(1)
==========

NAME
----
sgetopt - Parse command-line options


SYNOPSIS
--------

	#include <sgetopt.h>

	int sgetopt(int argc,
	            char * const argv[],
	            const struct soption optable[],
	            char *normal_args[],
	            int stop_at_nonoption);


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *sgetopt*() function parses command-line arguments.  It parses arguments in
a similar way to *getopt*(), albeit with a different interface.

The first two arguments, 'argc' and 'argv' have their usual meaning: count and
command line arguments.  The 'optable' argument is an array of 'struct
soption', containing the description of how to process the arguments.  The
'normal_args' will be written with all the non-option arguments, it 'should'
have space for 'argc+1' elements.  For convenience, 'normal_args' can be
pointed to 'argv', which, in this case, will be overwritten.  The last argument is
'stop_at_nonoption' which indicates wether sgetopt should stop processing at
the first non-option: this is useful when writting programs that run other
command line programs.

The struct soption is as follows, with comments describing what are each component:

	struct soption {
		char sname;
		char *lname;
		int has_arg;
		int (*func)(const char*,void*); /* must return 0 on success */
		void *arg;
	};

In this structure, 'sname' and 'lname' are respectively the short and long
versions of the option, e.g.: \'h\' (for -h) and "--help" (for --help).  The
boolean 'has_arg' indicates wether the command takes an argument (-l10, -l 10,
--length=10 or --length 10).

The 'func' is a callback which will process the argument, itself takes two
arguments, the argument to the command, if there is any, and a pointer to 'arg'
provided in the 'soption' struct.


RETURN VALUE
------------

This function returns 0 on success.  On error, it returns either 1 when
processing the arguments themselves, or the error code returned by one of the
'func' callbacks -- this way you can capture your own errors.


EXAMPLES
--------
The following example program uses *getopt*() to handle two program options:
'-n', with no associated value; and '-t' 'val', which expects an associated
string.  This has 'intentionally' the same functionality as the first example
provided in the *getopt*(3) manpage of version 3.66 of the Linux *man-pages*
project.

	/* TODO: Write this example */
	/* For now, you can download the evenmoreutils source and look at
	 * sgetopt_test for an example. */


BUGS
----
This documentation can, and will eventually, be improved.
