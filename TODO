evenmoreutils' TODO list
========================

This is a TODO list and a scrapbook for ideas.

Add a unbuffered option to sed.


Commands
--------

pork: pipe fork. Runs a program, piping it's standard output to another program
while passing it's standard error output to yet another program. Can be useful for implementing a poor man's version of hilite.

	pork somecommand -- cat -- hl -c red .*

Will make function pork also. Which will receive a function and two others and
does the job of porking (and the functions can be calls to execve! :P So it's
functionality is easily exported as a program.

	pork -- Scraped idea, bash will do


Merging trees: Add a command for merging trees of directories into a third one
that will contain links (or symbolic links) for the first ones).  Scraped idea,
cp will do.
