FIT(1)
======


NAME
----
fit, pad - truncates files by width and print on the standard output


SYNOPSIS
--------
*fit* [*-w* 'WIDTH'] [*-t* 'TABSIZE'] [*-c*] [*-p*] [*-W*] [*-M*] ['files']...

*pad* [*-w* 'WIDTH'] [*-t* 'TABSIZE'] [*-c*] [*-p*] [*-W*] [*-M*] ['files']...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fit* truncates a stream by fitting it into a certain width.  The width is read
from the environment variable 'COLUMNS' or guessed using termcap information. 
It can be overridden by passing a parame ter.  It is capable of padding the
output making it exactly the width.

*pad* pads the output wrapping lines when necessary.  This is the same as ``*fit -W -p*''.



OPTIONS
-------

*-w*, *--width*='WIDTH'::
Forces the width.  When no value is passed it is guessed by the COLUMNS
environment variable. When it has no value, from the termcap.  If guessing is
not possible and no value is passed 80 is the value.

*-t*, *--tabsize*='TABSIZE'::
	Sets the tabsize. Default is 8.

*-c*, *--converttabs*::
	Convert tabs to tabsize spaces.

*-p*, *--pad*::
	Pads output with spaces until it fits exactly the width.

*-W*, *--wrap*::
	Wraps output. Default is no.  When called as *pad* default is yes.

*-M*, *--no-wrap*::
	Do not wrap output.  Default is yes.  When called as pad default is no.


EXAMPLES
--------
Some examples of use with the same file:

	$ cat somefile.txt
	Well this is a text file
	with two lines

	$ fit somefile.txt
	Well this is a text file
	with two lines

	$ fit -w 10 somefile.txt
	Well, this
	with two l

	$ pad -w 30 somefile.txt
	Well, this is a text file     
	with two lines.               

	$ cat somefile.txt | pad -w 30 | tr ' ' _
	Well,_this_is_a_text_file_____
	with_two_lines._______________

	$ fit -w 20 --pad somefile.txt | tr ' ' _
	Well,_this_is_a_text
	with_two_lines._____
